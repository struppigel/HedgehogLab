# HedgehogLab

This repository contains samples to train malware analysis.

These samples reside in encrypted archives because they are actual malware samples and can cause damage if not handled properly. So make sure you have set up a secure malware lab before extracting any of those samples.

The password for the archives is "infected" (without quotes)

If you are not enrolled in my course but stumbled upon this repo because you are looking for trainings samples, check out [Samplepedia](https://samplepedia.cc/)

If you are coming from malwareanalysis-for-hedgehogs, welcome to the course. You may want to consider downloading the samples from here, which has a slightly nicer UI: [Samplepedia Course Sets](https://samplepedia.cc/courses/)
