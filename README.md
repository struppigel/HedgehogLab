# HedgehogLab

This repository contains samples to train malware analysis.

The samples reside in encrypted archives because they are actual malware samples and can cause damage if not handled properly. So make sure you have set up a secure malware lab before extracting any of those samples.

The password for the archives is "infected"

## Beginners

The course that uses the Beginners samples is [on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/windows-malware-analysis-for-hedgehogs-beginner-training/?referralCode=EE0E2DC9FA7388FF25B7)

Coupon links only last a few days, but I put new ones under each video that I release. So if you check the video description of most the recent video on [my channel](https://www.youtube.com/@MalwareAnalysisForHedgehogs), you should be able to find a coupon that is still working.

## Intermediate

This course is hosted on [malwareanalysis-for-hedgehogs.learnworlds.com](https://malwareanalysis-for-hedgehogs.learnworlds.com/)
